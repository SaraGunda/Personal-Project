      <p>
        Here are some definitions of common words you will hear throughout your
        flow, and this website.

      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>
        Asana: The Sanskrit word for “pose.” This is a general term that

      <h2>C</h2>
      <p>
        Chakras: Seven wheels of energy that are believed to be centered along
        the spine, from the base of the pelvis to the crown of the head. The

        red (at the base of your pelvis) to purple (at the crown of your head).
      </p>
      <p>
        Chaturanga: A yoga pose in which the body is held parallel to the floor

        body locks called Bandhas (Mula Bandha, Jalandhara Bandha, and Uddiyana
        Bandha). Typically this yoga is slightly slower-paced than modern

      <p>
        Namaste: A greeting used in Indian culture and yoga. You'll often hear
        your yoga teacher saying “namaste” as a closing at the end of class.
