        <!-- Here are some common yoga terms you may hear in class:


Asana: The Sanskrit word for “pose.” This is a general term that describes both sequences and a single pose in yoga.
Chakras: Seven wheels of energy that are believed to be centered along the spine, from the base of the pelvis to the crown of the head. The chakras are often associated with the colors of the rainbow, moving from red (at the base of your pelvis) to purple (at the crown of your head).
Chaturanga: A yoga pose in which the body is held parallel to the floor in a low plank, similar to a push-up.
Drishti: Focused gaze, or the practice of looking at a fixed point during yogic practice.
Hatha yoga: A modern type of yoga involving longer-held poses and three body locks called Bandhas (Mula Bandha, Jalandhara Bandha, and Uddiyana Bandha). Typically this yoga is slightly slower-paced than modern Vinyasa yoga, and sequences can vary.
Mantra: A word or saying that is repeated during meditation or yoga practice.
Mudra: A hand gesture held during meditation for a symbolic purpose.
Namaskar: A traditional Indian greeting or gesture of respect. Typically done when addressing a yoga instructor, at the end of a yoga class, or when saying “namaste.”
Namaste: A greeting used in Indian culture and yoga. You'll often hear your yoga teacher saying “namaste” as a closing at the end of class. Namaste translates to “I bow to you.” Usually, this greeting is given while pressing the palms against one another in front of the heart center, bowing the head towards the hands.




Prana: Energy or life force. It is often associated with the breath.
Pranayama: The practice of controlling your breath during yoga using methods like Ujjayi breathing techniques and mindfulness. Learn about Pranayama breathing techniques in our complete guide.
Restorative yoga: A type of yoga that focuses on deep relaxation through long-held poses often supported by various yoga props.
Sanskrit: A language of Southeast Asia frequently used in yoga for mantras, pose names, meditation techniques, and other yogic work. Some communities in India still speak Sanskrit.
Savasana: A resting pose often used at the end of modern yoga. Also called corpse pose.
Surya Namaskar: Sun Salutation, or a sequence of poses done to warm the body. There are three main variants of the Surya Namaskar, which all progress along different patterns.
Vinyasa: Sometimes used to refer to a series of postures done in the common Sun Salutation sequence.
Vinyasa yoga: A modern type of yoga where one pose flows into another, almost like a dance sequence. Practitioners typically do one breath and one posture in Vinyasa yoga.
Yoga: The practice of specific poses, meditation practices, and philosophy helps yoke breath, body, and mind for overall wellness.
Yin yoga: A practice of yoga that is similar to Restorative yoga. It uses long-held poses for deep stretching and relaxation but incorporates some practices of Chinese medicine.
